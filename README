Star Tune Lexibook List Generator
---------------------------------

This script helps to generate the file "list.list" in the DMPJ1 music player,
known as "Star Tune Lexibook". It replaces the Windows software that uploads
the mp3 files and generates the playlists.

How to use it ?
---------------

Put the script generate_list.py in the folders:

- Music Player
- Nightlight Sound
- Story 

Then, in each folder run it:

python generate_list.py

This will generate the file list.list. Repeat this operation in each folder.

If your mp3 filenames contains special characters, you may automatically
rename them running:

python generate_list.py -r
